The process of updating your Better Vim takes just one command:

```bash
curl -L https://bettervim.com/update/latest | bash
```

<Note>
When you install Better Vim, we create a <strong>.bettervimrc</strong> file on the <strong>~/.config/better-vim/</strong> directory. This file stores your license key, that is used by the update script.
