## Changing the theme

The default theme is **Catppuccin**. If you want to change the theme, just change the `theme.name` on the Better Vim config:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  theme = {
    name = "dracula"
  }
}
```
### Available themes:

- `catppuccin`
- `dracula`
- `ayu` (and its variants, check [here](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors))
- `palenight`
- `tokyonight`
- `nord`
- `onedark`
- `rose-pine`
- `nightfox` (and its variants, check [here](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim#nightfox-1))

## Changing the flavour

Some themes like **Catppuccin** or **Ayu** have theme flavours. These flavours can be changed using the flavour key for the respective theme. For example,
if you're using Catppuccin and want to change the flavour from the default flavour `frappe` to `latte` you can do this by changing your config to something like:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  theme = {
    name = "catppuccin",
    // Add this line
    catppuccin_flavour = "latte"
  }
}
```

Or, if you're using **Ayu**, you can change the theme flavour doing something like:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  theme = {
    name = "ayu",
    ayucolor = "light"
  }
}
```
<Note>
It's important to notice that each theme has its own <span>flavour key</span>. For example: The flavour key for Catppuccin is <code>catppuccin_flavour</code>, but for Ayu is <code>ayucolor</code>. You can see all flavours and flavour keys below.
</Note>

          },
        },
      },
    }
```
- For all other themes, just change `theme.name`.

## Installing custom themes

You can install custom themes using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) which is the default plugin manager for Better Vim.
Let's see how to install the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/) theme:

### 1. Adding it the to the plugins list

Better vim allows you to install custom plugins using the `plugins` entry in `better-vim.lua` file. A neovim/vim theme is also considered a vim plugin.
You can install the Gruvbox by adding this following code to the `plugins` entry in `better-vim.lua` file:

<CodeSnippet
  code={`return {
  plugins = {
    "morhetz/gruvbox",
  },
}`}
  lang="javascript"
  fileType="config"
/>
<br />
<br />

Reopen your Neovim and you'll see that `lazy.nvim` is installing the theme automatically.

### 2. Setting up the theme

Now, open your Better Vim config and change the `theme.name` to `gruvbox`:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  plugins = {
   "morhetz/gruvbox",
  },
  theme = {
    name = "gruvbox",
  }
}
```
<br />
<br />
Now, reopen your **neovim** and tada ðŸŽ‰ you should see the new theme applied to your setup.
