title: How it works
---
When you install BetterVim, we create some folders on your environment:

### `~/.config/nvim`
Where your neovim config lives. Don't touch these files if you want to receive Better Vim updates.

### `~/.config/better-vim`
This folder contains your customizations. You'll see two files that you can use to create customizations and overrides:
- `better-vim.lua` - You'll use this lua file to pass options to Better Vim like the theme name/flavour and your custom mappings.
- `.bettervimrc` - Do not touch this file. It contains your license key from Gumroad that we use to install the updates for Better Vim.

# The `better-vim.lua` file

This documentation provides an overview of the `better-vim.lua` file, which serves
as the entry point for configuring Better Vim.

The `better-vim.lua` file is located in `~/.config/better-vim/better-vim.lua`.
This file acts as the main configuration file for Better Vim and allows you to
organize your configuration files and plugins within the `~/.config/better-vim/`
directory.

Check the [**File Structure**](#file-structure) session to learn more.

## Configuration Options

The `better-vim.lua` file provides various configuration options to customize your
Vim environment. Below are the defaults for all possible entries to `better-vim.lua` file:

```lua
return {
  plugins = {},
  unload_plugins = {},
  lsps = {},
  formatters = {},
  treesitter = {},
  gitsigns = {},
  noice = {},
  theme = {
    name = "catppuccin",
    catppuccin_flavour = "mocha",
    ayucolor = "dark",
    nightfox = {},
    rose_pine = {
      dark_variant = "main",
    },
  },
  flags = {
    disable_auto_theme_loading = false,
    disable_tabs = false,
    format_on_save = false,
    experimental_tsserver = false,
  },
  hooks = {},
  mappings = {
    leader = " ",
    tabs = nil,
    custom = {},
    by_mode = {
      n = {},
      i = {},
      v = {},
      x = {},
    },
  },
  lualine = {
    options = {},
    sections = {},
  },
  telescope = {},
  nvim_tree = {},
  whichkey = {},
  dashboard = {
    header = {},
  },
}
```

Throughout this documentation you will find all the necessary information to know
what each of this entries means.

You can explore and modify them according to your preferences and needs.

## File Structure

The file structure for Better Vim configuration follows the organization within
the `~/.config/better-vim/` directory.

You can break your configuration in small modules to organize them better.

For example, if you have a configuration file called `plugins.lua`, it should be
placed inside the `~/.config/better-vim/` directory.

You can import modules and configuration files using the `better-vim` namespace.
To import a module, use the following syntax:

```lua plugins.lua
require "better-vim.module_name"
```

Replace `module_name` with the name of the module or configuration file you want
to import.

In the above example, if you want to put all your plugins inside
the file `plugins.lua`, just create this file inside `~/.config/better-vim/` directory
and import it in `better-vim.lua`:

```lua better-vim.lua
local plugins = require "better-vim.plugins"

return {
  plugins = plugins,
}
```

## Better Vim Utils

We expose some functions that you can use to improve your customizations.

To use those functions, just import the `better-vim-utils` module and use them:

```lua better-vim.lua
local utils = require "better-vim-utils"
```

### Exposed functions

#### `load_theme` (deprecated)

> **NOTE:** If you're using this function, please, update to the latest version of Better Vim and use
`should_load_theme` instead. This function will be removed in the next major release.

This function will be used to load a custom theme only after all other plugins are already loaded.
It will ensure your theme will have all the correct functionalities expected by your plugins.

The function expects your theme configuration table as argument and returns this table with
some additional properties (`lazy = false` and `priority = 1000`), to load the theme only when all other plugins are ready.

Here is an example of using this function to load [**poimandres**](https://github.com/olivercederborg/poimandres.nvim) theme:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  plugins = {
    utils.load_theme {
      "olivercederborg/poimandres.nvim",
      config = function()
        require "poimandres".setup {}
        vim.cmd [[ colorscheme poimandres ]]
      end,
    }
  }
}
```

#### `should_load_theme`

This function will be used to load a custom theme only after all other plugins are already loaded,
and only if the theme itself is in use.
It will ensure your theme will have all the correct functionalities expected by your plugins.

The function expects two arguments: first one is the name of your theme, and second one is your 
theme configuration table, that will be returned with some additional properties 
(`lazy = false` and `priority = 1000`), to load the theme only when all other plugins are ready.

Here is an example of using this function to load [**poimandres**](https://github.com/olivercederborg/poimandres.nvim) theme:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  plugins = {
    utils.should_load_theme("poimandres", {
      "olivercederborg/poimandres.nvim",
      config = function()
        require "poimandres".setup {}
        vim.cmd [[ colorscheme poimandres ]]
      end,
    }),
  }
}
```

#### `statusline.get_file_name`

This function will be used with `lualine` plugin. 

It will show `ÔÅª Explorer` text when `NvimTree` buffer is in focus, and the 
_filename_ when you have a file opened and the file buffer is in focus:

Usage example:

```lua better-vim.lua
local utils = require "better-vim-utils"

return {
  lualine = {
    sections = {
      c = { utils.statusline.get_file_name },
    },
  }
}
```
