title: How it works
---
When you install BetterVim, we create some folders on your environment:

### `~/.config/nvim`
Where your neovim config lives. Don't touch these files if you want to receive Better Vim updates.

### `~/.config/better-vim`
This folder contains your customizations. You'll see two files that you can use to create customizations and overrides:
- `better-vim.lua` - You'll use this lua file to pass options to Better Vim like the theme name/flavour and your custom mappings.
- `.bettervimrc` - Do not touch this file. It contains your license key from Gumroad that we use to install the updates for Better Vim.

# The `better-vim.lua` file

This documentation provides an overview of the `better-vim.lua` file, which serves
as the entry point for configuring Better Vim.

The `better-vim.lua` file is located in `~/.config/better-vim/better-vim.lua`.
This file acts as the main configuration file for Better Vim and allows you to
organize your configuration files and plugins within the `~/.config/better-vim/`
directory.

Check the [**File Structure**](#file-structure) session to learn more.

## Configuration Options

The `better-vim.lua` file provides various configuration options to customize your
Vim environment. Below are the defaults for all possible entries to `better-vim.lua` file:

```lua
return {
  plugins = {},
  unload_plugins = {},
  lsps = {},
  formatters = {},
  treesitter = {},
  gitsigns = {},
  noice = {},
  theme = {
    name = "catppuccin",
    catppuccin_flavour = "mocha",
    ayucolor = "dark",
    nightfox = {},
    rose_pine = {
      dark_variant = "main",
    },
  },
  flags = {
    disable_auto_theme_loading = false,
    disable_tabs = false,
    format_on_save = false,
  },
  hooks = {},
  mappings = {
    leader = " ",
    tabs = nil,
    custom = {},
    by_mode = {
      n = {},
      i = {},
      v = {},
      x = {},
    },
  },
  lualine = {
    options = {},
    sections = {},
  },
  telescope = {},
  nvim_tree = {},
  whichkey = {},
}
```

Throughout this documentation you will find all the necessary information to know
what each of this entries means.

You can explore and modify them according to your preferences and needs.

## File Structure

The file structure for Better Vim configuration follows the organization within
the `~/.config/better-vim/` directory.

You can break your configuration in small modules to organize them better.

For example, if you have a configuration file called `plugins.lua`, it should be
placed inside the `~/.config/better-vim/` directory.

You can import modules and configuration files using the `better-vim` namespace.
To import a module, use the following syntax:

```lua plugins.lua
require "better-vim.module_name"
```

Replace `module_name` with the name of the module or configuration file you want
to import.

In the above example, if you want to put all your plugins inside
the file `plugins.lua`, just create this file inside `~/.config/better-vim/` directory
and import it in `better-vim.lua`:

```lua better-vim.lua
local plugins = require "better-vim.plugins"

return {
  plugins = plugins,
}
```
