## Installing New Language Servers (LSPs) with Mason

Better Vim provides seamless integration with various Language Servers (LSPs)
through the use of Mason. Mason simplifies the setup and configuration of LSPs
within Better Vim, allowing you to enhance your coding experience with specific
language features and intelligent code suggestions.

To install a new LSP using Mason, follow these steps:

- Open the `better-vim.lua` file located in your Better Vim configuration directory.
- Locate the `lsps` entry within the configuration file. If it doesn't exist,
you can create it as an empty table using the following format:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
   lsps = {},
 }
```

- Inside the `lsps` table, add a new entry for the desired language server.
The key should be a unique identifier for the LSP, and the value should be an
empty table. This table is used to configure the specific settings and `on_attach`
function for the LSP through lspconfig. For example, to install the `prismals`
language server, your configuration would look like this:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
   lsps = {
     prismals = {}, -- Configuration settings for "prismals" LSP
   },
 }
```

<Note>
You can find all available LSPs using the command `:Mason` and doing a `Ctrl + F`
to find the language server you want to install.
</Note>

- Customize the configuration settings for the LSP within its respective table.
You can refer to the documentation of the specific LSP or lspconfig for the
available options and their meanings.

To add settings or customize the `on_attach` function, see the example below:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  lsps = {
    tsserver = {
      settings = {
        -- tsserver settings live here. If you don't have settings, you don't need
        -- to add this section.
      },
      on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
        require "twoslash-queries".on_attach(client, bufnr)
      end,
    },
  }
}
```

- Save the `better-vim.lua` file.

- Restart Better Vim or reload the configuration to apply the changes.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a new Language Server using Mason.
Better Vim will now utilize the features provided by the LSP to enhance your
coding workflow.

## Installing New Formatters with none-ls

none-ls is a plugin integrated with Better Vim that enables you to format your code
using various formatters. By leveraging none-ls, you can maintain consistent code
formatting and adhere to coding style guidelines across different programming languages.

To install a new formatter using none-ls, follow these steps:

- Open the `better-vim.lua` file located in your Better Vim configuration directory.

- Locate the `formatters` entry within the configuration file. If it doesn't
exist, you can create it as an empty table using the following format:


```lua better-vim.lua
return {
   formatters = {},
 }
```

- Inside the `formatters` table, add a new entry for the desired formatter.
The key should be a unique identifier for the formatter, and the value should be
an empty table. This table is passed to the `with` method when configuring formatting sources
for none-ls. For example, to install the `blade_formatter` formatter, your
configuration would look like this:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
   formatters = {
     blade_formatter = {} -- Configuration for "blade_formatter" formatter
   }
 }
```

<Note>
You can find all formatters for none-ls following <a href='https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim/blob/main/doc/BUILTINS.md#formatting' target='_blank'>this page</a>
on the documetation. Just put the name of the formatter, you don't need the part `null_ls.builtins.formatting`
</Note>

- Customize the configuration settings for the formatter within its respective table.
The available options and their meanings may vary depending on the formatter you
are using. Refer to the documentation of the specific formatter for more information on the
available options.

- Save the `better-vim.lua` file.

- Restart Better Vim or reload the configuration to apply the changes.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a new formatter using none-ls.
Better Vim will now utilize the formatter to format your code according to the
specified configuration, helping you maintain consistent and well-formatted code.
