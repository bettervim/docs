Better Vim provides the flexibility to override the default configurations or add
new ones by utilizing the `hooks.before_setup` and `hooks.after_setup` functions.
These functions allow you to modify various aspects of Better Vim's behavior
before and after the setup process.

## `hooks.before_setup`

The `hooks.before_setup` function is called before the Better Vim setup process
begins. It serves as a hook where you can make modifications or override default
configurations. Here's an example of how to use `hooks.before_setup`:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  hooks = {
    before_setup = function()
      -- Do something before Better Vim starts its setup process
    end,
  },
}
```

The `hooks.before_setup` function is not that useful, but it is there if you need it.

## `hooks.after_setup`

The `hooks.after_setup` function is called after the Better Vim setup process has
completed. It provides an opportunity to further customize or extend Better Vim's
functionality. Here's an example of how to use `hooks.after_setup`:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  hooks = {
    after_setup = function()
      -- Perform additional configuration or add new functionality here
    end,
  },
}
```

Within the `hooks.after_setup` function, you can add additional configurations,
keybindings, or any other customization that you desire.

This allows you to enhance the default Better Vim setup with your own preferences
or extend it with additional features.

## Examples

Let's take a look at a few examples to illustrate how you can utilize `hooks` to
override defaults or add new configurations:

### 1. Add custom keybinding

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  hooks = {
    after_setup = function()
      vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>l', ':set number!<CR>', { silent = true })
    end,
  },
}
```

This example adds a custom keybinding using `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap` within
`hooks.after_setup`. The keybinding toggles line numbers when `<Leader>l` is
pressed in normal mode.

### 2. Load additional configuration file
```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  hooks = {
    after_setup = function()
      require "better-vim.my_custom_config"
    end,
  },
}
```

In this example, an additional configuration file named `my_custom_config.lua`
is loaded using `require` within `hooks.after_setup`.

This allows you to separate your custom configurations into separate files for
better organization and load them only after all the Better Vim setup is done.
