### I can't see folders like .github or dotfiles

By default we hide any dotfile like `.github` or `.husky` and files ignored by your `.gitignore`. If you want to show
these files/folders, you have two options:

- With your cursor on the file explorer, press <span>shift</span> + <span>u</span> and/or <span>shift</span> + <span>i</span> to show dotfiles/ignored files.
- Or, you can also change the default filters for the file explorer. Please check out the customization section of the file explorer [here](/customization/plugins#nvimtree-options-(file-explorer)).

### Icons are not working

You need to install a powerline font like [NERD Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and set it up that font in your terminal. We're using **SpaceMono Nerd Font** in our screenshots. A powerline font is required for a better experience, since we're using a font-based icons in the file explorer, file finder, etc.

### How to change the default leader

Check this [guide](/mappings/custom-mappings#changing-the-default-leader-key).

### How to create custom mappings

### I don't have the .bettervimrc

To create the `.bettervimrc` file on your setup, run the following comand:

```bash
curl -L https://bettervim.com/bettervimrc/YOUR_LICENSE | bash
```
<Note>Don't forget to replace <span>YOUR_LICENSE</span> with your license key provided by Gumroad.</Note>

### I'm seeing weird error messages

If you already had a previous installation of Neovim, and after installed Better Vim
you are seeing some weird error messages, you should clean up your system,
removing everything that was automatically created by Neovim or its dependencies.

Follow the steps below:

- First, [uninstall Better Vim](/uninstalling)
- Delete all Neovim related directories:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
```

- Now you can [install Better Vim](/installation) again.

If you keep seeing weird errors, feel free to drop us a message at [bettervim@gmail.com](bettervim@gmail.com)
and we'll try to help you.
