## Setting custom icons
If you want to set custom icons for elements like tabs, file explorer, file finder, etc, just add this following config to the entry `hooks.after_setup` in `better-vim.lua` file:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  hooks = {
    after_setup = function()
      require("nvim-web-devicons").set_icon {
        res = {
          icon = "ï¬¦",
          color = "#e6484f",
          name = "ReScript"
        }
      }
    end,
  },
}
```

Since we're using **nvim-web-devicons** as our icons plugin, you can see more about custom icons on its [official documentation](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons).
