### Changing the default leader key
Better Vim uses the `Space` key as the default leader. If you want to change it, you can use the `better-vim.lua` file.
To change your leader from `Space` to `,` you can update your `better-vim.lua` to something like:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  mappings = {
    leader = ",",
  },
}
```
### Creating your own mappings
There are two ways to create your own custom mappings:
- Using the [whichkey.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) plugin + the Better Vim modules;
- Using `lua` and `hooks.after_setup` hook in `better-vim.lua`.

### Creating mappings with whichkey
To create your own mappings using the whichkey plugin you'll use the `better-vim.lua` module. Let's see how to create a mapping to open the file explorer using `ctrl + b`:
```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  mappings = {
    custom = {
    ["<c-b>"] = {
       "<cmd>NvimTreeToggle<cr>",
       "Open file explorer",
      },
    },
  },
}
```
We can split the mapping creation into 3 parts:
- 1. On the line `4` we define the combination of keys that we want to use
- 2. On the line `5` we set the command that we want to execute
- 3. And on the line `6` we set a description for this mapping

ðŸ“¢ Since we're using whichkey.nvim to create custom mappings, you may want to check its [official documentation](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/blob/main/doc/which-key.nvim.txt) before creating your own mappings.

### Creating mappings by mode

You can also create your own mappings **by mode**. This is important if you have
the same shortcuts, but want different commands for different modes:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  mappings = {
    by_mode = {
      i = {}, -- use these tables to create your mapings
      v = {}, -- â”™
    },
  },
}
```

You can use `i` (for `insert` mode), `n` (for `normal` mode), `v` (for `visual`
and `select` modes) or `x` (for only `visual` mode). The options are the same as
used in `mappings.custom`.

### Creating mappings for tabs

You can create custom mappings to change tabs. The default mapping is `alt/option` + **tab number**.
To customize it, just pass a function to the `tabs` key inside `mappings` table.
The function receives the `tab` number. That way you just concatenate the tab number with your custom keys:

``` lua better-vim.lua
return {
  mappings = {
  tabs = function(tab)
    return "<leader>h" .. tab
  end,
  }
}
```

The example above will create the mappings:

```
<leader>h1 -> first tab
<leader>h2 -> second tab
...
<leader>h20 -> twentyth tab
```

Now, you can use `<leader>h1` to go to tab 1, instead of `alt` + `1`.

### Creating mappings with lua

To create custom mappings using `lua` you can use the `hooks.after_setup` entry in `better-vim.lua` file, following this [tutorial](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide-mappings)
from the Neovim official documentation.

### Custom mappings for autocomplete (cmp) 

You can customize your mappings for autocomplete (`nvim-cmp`) using `lua`, just use the `cmp` entry in your configuration. 
Check out the example below with defaults:

```lua better-vim.lua
return {
  cmp = {
    mappings = {
      scroll_docs_down = "<C-d>",
      scroll_docs_up = "<C-u>",
      next_item = "<C-n>",
      prev_item = "<C-p>",
      show_list = "<C-Space>",
      confirm = "<CR>",
    },
    before_default_sources = {},
    after_default_sources = {},
  }
}
```

The `before_default_sources` and `after_default_sources` options can be used to load 
`nvim-cmp` plugins before and after the default sources that is already installed with Better Vim.
If you want to know more about `nvim-cmp` sources, check out the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp).
